# DataCamp-Projects

Building data pipelines is one of the crucial skills for Data Engineers nowadays. It involves: extracting, transforming, and loading the data.

In this project, you will work with retail data from a multinational retail corporation Walmart. You will retrieve data from different sources, like SQL and parquet; prepare the data using some transformation techniques, and finally load the data in an easy-to-access format.
